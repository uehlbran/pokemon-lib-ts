/**
 * Discriminated union of all events emitted by the BattleEngine during a battle.
 *
 * Consumers subscribe via `BattleEngine.on()` or read the full log via `getEventLog()`.
 * Each event has a unique `type` string literal that narrows the union:
 *
 * - `battle-start` — emitted once when `BattleEngine.start()` is called
 * - `turn-start` — emitted at the beginning of each turn
 * - `switch-in` — a Pokémon enters the field (lead send-out, voluntary switch, or post-faint)
 * - `switch-out` — a Pokémon is withdrawn from the field
 * - `move-start` — a Pokémon begins executing a move
 * - `move-miss` — a move fails the accuracy check
 * - `move-fail` — a move fails for a non-accuracy reason (e.g., immune target, no valid target)
 * - `damage` — HP is removed from a Pokémon
 * - `heal` — HP is restored to a Pokémon
 * - `faint` — a Pokémon's HP reaches 0
 * - `effectiveness` — type-effectiveness multiplier for the last damage event
 * - `critical-hit` — the last damage event was a critical hit
 * - `status-inflict` — a primary status condition is applied
 * - `status-cure` — a primary status condition is removed
 * - `volatile-start` — a volatile (in-battle-only) status begins
 * - `volatile-end` — a volatile status ends
 * - `stat-change` — a stat stage changes (e.g., Growl, Swords Dance)
 * - `weather-set` — weather is set or overwritten
 * - `weather-end` — weather expires naturally
 * - `terrain-set` — terrain is set or overwritten (Gen 6+)
 * - `terrain-end` — terrain expires naturally
 * - `ability-activate` — an ability triggers (e.g., Intimidate, Speed Boost)
 * - `item-activate` — a held item activates (e.g., berry, orb)
 * - `item-consumed` — a held item is permanently used up
 * - `hazard-set` — an entry hazard layer is added to a side
 * - `hazard-clear` — entry hazards are removed from a side (Rapid Spin, Defog)
 * - `screen-set` — a protective screen (Reflect, Light Screen) is set on a side
 * - `screen-end` — a screen expires or is broken
 * - `mega-evolve` — a Pokémon mega evolves (Gen 6+)
 * - `dynamax` — a Pokémon dynamaxes (Gen 8)
 * - `dynamax-end` — a Pokémon reverts from Dynamax
 * - `terastallize` — a Pokémon terastallizes (Gen 9)
 * - `z-move` — a Z-Move is used (Gen 7)
 * - `catch-attempt` — a Poké Ball is thrown in a wild battle
 * - `exp-gain` — a Pokémon gains experience points
 * - `level-up` — a Pokémon's level increases
 * - `flee-attempt` — a flee attempt was made in a wild battle
 * - `message` — a freeform text message (fallback for unstructured events)
 * - `battle-end` — the battle has concluded
